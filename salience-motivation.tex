Consider the two passages in Figure \ref{fig:Salience} from two news articles about the entity \textit{Boris Johnson} which address his role as the \textit{Prime Minister of the UK} and his response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

   \begin{quote}
\textbf{Passage 1.} The British government came under heightened pressure to disclose details about a secretive scientific advisory group after a report on Friday that a top political aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson had taken part in the group’s meetings on the coronavirus pandemic. \\
\textbf{Passage 2.} British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is resisting growing calls to reopen the UK from its lockdown because he is still so “frightened” from his own near-fatal brush with the bug, according to a report .
\end{quote}
    \caption{Salient versus Non-Salient Passage. Passage 2 is salient for entity \textit{Boris Johnson} whereas Passage 1 is not.}

We notice that Passage 2 \footnote{https://nypost.com/2020/04/21/boris-johnson-too-frightened-to-ease-uk-coronavirus-lockdown/} in Figure \ref{fig:Salience} discusses how the entity \textit{Boris Johnson} in his role as the Prime Minister of the UK is affecting the pandemic situation, whereas Passage 1 \footnote{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/world/europe/uk-dominic-cummings-sage-coronavirus.html} just mentions the entity on the side. Hence, the entity is central (\textit{salient}) in Passage 2 whereas in Passage 1, it is not. 
%We say that \textit{Boris Johnson} is \textit{salient} in Passage 2. Hence, by \textit{salient}, we mean that the entity is \textit{central} to the text in which it is mentioned. 
In a sentence such as \textit{Boris Johnson, perhaps the world's most famous coronavirus patient, was back at work on Monday \footnote{https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/boris-johnson-returns-to-work-after-missing-worst-of-coronavirus-epidemic/2020/04/27/95b590ea-8630-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111\_story.html}}, we would not only prefer to link the mention \textit{Boris Johnson} to the aspect \textit{Prime Minister of the UK}, but also to one in which the entity is salient, such as one with content Passage 2.

%Consider the following sentence from a new article about \textit{Boris Johnson}.

%\begin{quote}
%    \textit{Boris Johnson, perhaps the world's most famous coronavirus patient, was back at work Monday — after spending the worst of Britain's epidemic sidelined, first in self-isolation, then struggling to breathe in the hospital, and later in recovery in the countryside \footnote{https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/boris-johnson-returns-to-work-after-missing-worst-of-coronavirus-epidemic/2020/04/27/95b590ea-8630-11ea-81a3-9690c9881111\_story.html}}.

%In a sentence such as the one above, we would not only prefer to link the mention \textit{Boris Johnson} to the aspect \textit{Prime Minister of the UK}, but also to one in which the entity is salient.
