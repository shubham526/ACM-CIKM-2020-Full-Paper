This work addresses the task of entity aspect linking and studies the effectiveness of using entity salience and relatedness on the task using two off-the-shelf tools not trained for this task. We show that although these tools have some inherent defects, a supervised combination of salience and relatedness features with lexical and semantic features can outperform several established baselines. In particular, we show that such a supervised combination learns complimentary information which aids the performance of the supervised system. Moreover, we find that using the frequency of co-occurring entities is better than using their relatedness since frequently co-occurring entities are mostly related, but related entities might not co-occur frequently.
